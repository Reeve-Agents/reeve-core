# reeve-core

Shared domain model: rulebook schemas, domain packs, simulation views and the sample businesses.

Every other repo depends on this one. It holds the zod schemas for rule cards and rulebooks, the domain
packs (rent collection, minimarket, generic SOPs), the simulation views the apps draw, the revision diff,
the operation records the API returns, and the sample businesses under `fixtures/`.

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

Entry points: `@reeve/core`, `@reeve/core/packs`, `@reeve/core/simview`, `@reeve/core/revision`,
`@reeve/core/fixtures-dir` (Node only) and `@reeve/core/fixtures/<business>/<file>`.

Pack views speak English by default (developer studio, landing page) or Indonesian for the owner app:
`packFor(rulebook, "id")`, `dayLines(events, date, "id")`, `rupiah(n, "id")`, `shortDate(date, "id")`.

## Working across repos

Shared packages are installed straight from GitHub (`"@reeve/core": "github:Reeve-Agents/reeve-core#main"`) and pinned by
`package-lock.json`. After a change lands in one of them, pull it in with:

```bash
npm update @reeve/core
```

To edit two repos side by side, clone them next to each other and link the local copy:

```bash
npm install ../reeve-core --no-save
```
